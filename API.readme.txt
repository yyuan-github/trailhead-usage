Trailhead Beta API Usage Notes

To use the API (https://api.trailhead.salesforce.com), you need some basic pieces for access

1. Get API Key from Adam Torman -- one time only

2. Get Access Token -- you'll need this occasionally as it times out. You can do this via Chuck Mortimore's tool (https://openidconnect.herokuapp.com/)
  - Open that URL in a fresh browser session (e.g., anonymous)
  - Check/change login host 
  - Hit Next
  - Authenticate (using our Org62 account)
  - Hit Next (you should land in bubble 3
  - Jot down the Access Token on the left top of the screen -- it's a long string so be sure to copy it all

With those two pieces, you can use the api via:

 a) web UI on https://api.trailhead.salesforce.com
  - find the "Click to authorize if Red" button and click the red "!"
  - fill in the X-API-key field with the API Key value
  - fill in the Authorization field with the string "Bearer: <xxx>" where <xxx> is the Access Token

 b) via curl - see curl examples in https://api.trailhead.salesforce.com
